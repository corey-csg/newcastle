# Email Draft to BD Partner

**Context**: Short, text-message-friendly. Attach the markitecture diagram.

---

## Option A: Super Short (Text-Ready)

> Hey [Name] - Been digging into this and I'm excited. Put together a quick visual of what I'm thinking (attached). I've got some questions on data sourcing and go-to-market I'd love to bounce off you. When can we talk?

---

## Option B: Slightly More (Still Short)

> [Name] -
>
> I've been doing some homework on this opportunity and I'm genuinely energized by it. The problem is real, the timing is right, and I think I can add a lot on the product/architecture side.
>
> Attached is a quick diagram I put together showing the value flow. Would love your thoughts.
>
> I have some questions I'd like to work through before our next group conversation. Got 20 minutes this week?

---

## Option C: If You Need a Touch More Positioning

> [Name] -
>
> This has been living in my head since we talked. I've been sketching out the architecture and I see a clear path to an MVP.
>
> Quick visual attached - shows the inputs, the platform, and the value delivery. Let me know if this matches your thinking.
>
> I want to make sure I understand the landscape and your vision before we go further. Can we grab 20 min?

## Notes

- Don't over-explain in the email - the diagram does the talking
- The ask is simple: a short call to discuss
- The subtext: "I'm already working on this, I'm serious, and I'm thinking like an owner"
