# Positioning Brief: Co-Founder Role

## The Situation

You've been brought into a nascent venture by the BD partner. Three others started the conversation; you were invited because of your relationship and your skills. You need to position yourself not as a hired contributor, but as an equal co-founder who owns the product/technical/operational core.

---

## Your Unique Value

| What You Bring | Why It Matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| 25 years building healthcare reference content systems | You've done exactly this before |
| Product leadership + technical depth | Rare combination - you're the translator who can also build |
| Previous founding team experience (reference content company) | You know the playbook |
| Content architecture expertise | The data model IS the core IP |
| Operational process design | The difference between a project and a scalable company |

---

## Positioning Mindset

**Don't position against the others.** Position yourself as the person who makes the whole thing real.

- BD brings deals and relationships → but someone has to build what gets sold
- CMO brings clinical credibility → but someone has to design the content system
- RCM Consultant brings domain expertise → but someone has to translate that into product

**You are the integrator.** You take everyone's input and turn it into something that works.

## Practice Sentences

### Establishing Your Role (Low-Key, Collaborative)

> "I've been thinking about how I can contribute most effectively. Given my background in content architecture and product, I'd like to own the product and technical strategy - the data model, the content pipeline, the MVP. Happy to collaborate with everyone on requirements, but I want to be the one accountable for making it real."

> "I've built systems like this before. Not exactly this, but the pattern - aggregating reference content, normalizing it, serving it through multiple channels. I have a pretty clear picture of what needs to happen technically. I'd love to walk you through my thinking."

> "I see my role as turning the domain expertise you all bring into a product that works. I want to own that translation."

### Showing Energy Without Being Pushy

> "I've been doing some research on the problem space and I'm genuinely excited. The data sourcing challenges are solvable, and the AI-native approach opens up some interesting possibilities. I've sketched out some early architecture thinking - happy to share when we're ready."

> "I put together some initial diagrams to test my understanding of the value prop. Attached is a high-level view. Would love your feedback - does this capture what you're thinking?"

> "I'm ready to start building whenever we have alignment on direction. I've got capacity and I'm motivated to move fast."

### Asking for What You Want (Directly, Respectfully)

> "I want to make sure we're aligned on roles and equity before we go too deep. I see myself as a co-founder here, not a contractor. Is that how you're thinking about it too?"

> "What's your thinking on how we structure this? I want to be in a position where I have ownership and upside commensurate with what I'm putting in."

> "I'm happy to lead the product and technical side. But I want to make sure we're all on the same page about what that means in terms of equity and decision-making authority."

### Demonstrating Leadership (Actions, Not Claims)

> "I've already started mapping out the content architecture. Here's my thesis on the data model - I'd value your input, especially from the RCM side on whether this matches how you think about rules."

> "I drafted some questions I think we need to answer before we go further. Can we schedule time to work through these together?"

> "I built a quick prototype of the document ingestion pipeline to test the feasibility. It's rough, but it shows the concept works."

## What NOT to Say

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "I should be CEO because..." | Let the role emerge from what you do, not what you claim |
| "I'm the most qualified to..." | Sounds defensive; show, don't tell |
| "Without me, this won't work" | True, but antagonizing |
| "What's in it for me?" | Sounds transactional; reframe as alignment |

---

## Key Reframes

| Old Frame (Staff) | New Frame (Founder) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "How can I help?" | "Here's what I'm going to own." |
| "What do you need me to build?" | "Here's my proposal for the architecture." |
| "Let me know when you need something" | "I've already started on X - here's where I am." |
| "I contributed to the product" | "I built the product." |

---

## The Goal

After the next conversation, they should be thinking:

> "This is clearly a co-founder. He's already thinking like an owner, he's already building, and he's the one who's going to make this real."

---

## Reminder

You're not asking for permission. You're offering to lead. The difference is posture, not words.
