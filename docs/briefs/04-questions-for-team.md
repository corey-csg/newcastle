# Questions to Ask the Team

*Framed as CEO/CPO questions, not technical contributor questions.*

## Business & Market (directed at BD partner)

1. **"What's our thesis on 'why now'?"** - Why hasn't this been solved? What changed?

2. **"Who are the 2-3 closest competitors and what's their weakness?"** - What gap do we exploit?

3. **"What's the realistic sales cycle for our target customer?"** - Months? Who signs? Budget authority?

4. **"What's our GTM motion—founder-led sales, partnerships, channel?"**

5. **"What does a $1M ARR customer base look like?"** - 10 customers at $100K? 100 at $10K?

7. **"How many payers would we need to cover to be useful for a mid-size health system?"** - Is it 10? 50? 200?

8. **"What's the taxonomy of rule types?"** - Coverage, coding, billing, payment, prior auth... what's the ontology?

9. **"What sources are authoritative vs. nice-to-have?"** - CMS is mandatory; what else?

## Why These Questions Matter

These questions position you as someone thinking about the **whole business**, not just waiting for technical requirements. They signal:

- You're evaluating the opportunity, not just accepting it
- You're thinking about roles, equity, and decision-making upfront
- You understand that product/technical strategy depends on business strategy
- You're a peer, not an employee
