# Newcastle Diagram Iteration Log

This document records the iteration process for refining Newcastle's architectural diagrams to stakeholder consensus.

## Stakeholder Personas

Four personas evaluated each diagram:
1. **C-Suite Executive** - Business value, ROI, board-readiness
2. **Tech Leadership** - Technical accuracy, architecture soundness
3. **Customer (RCM Director)** - Problem/solution fit, workflow alignment
4. **Sales/BD Leader** - Sellability, differentiation, conversation starter

## Markitecture Diagram

### Source: `src/newcastle-markitecture-final.d2`
### Output: `output/newcastle-markitecture-final.png` and `.svg`

### Iteration Summary

| Version | Key Changes | Consensus |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| v8 (baseline) | Original layout with Data Sources on right | ❌ Needs revision |
| v9 | Restructured to top-down flow, added title | ✅ Approved with notes |
| v10 (final) | Unified "Inputs" container, cyan title | ✅ Full approval |

### Key Feedback Themes

**v8 Issues:**
- Layout asymmetrical - Data Sources floating to the right
- Provider Config appeared disconnected and orphaned
- "personalizes" label was barely visible and unclear
- Not board-ready - looked like a draft

**v9 Improvements:**
- Clear top-to-bottom flow established
- Added "Newcastle — Payer Rules Intelligence" title
- Better visual balance

**v10 Final Polish:**
- All inputs unified in single "Inputs" container
- "Your Setup" visually distinguished (lighter gray) from external data sources
- Cyan brand title draws attention
- Single clean arrow from inputs to Newcastle

### Final Design Decisions

1. **Layout**: Vertical top-to-bottom flow (Inputs → Newcastle → Delivery → Value)
2. **Color Coding**:
   - Cyan (#00AEEF) for Newcastle hero and delivery channels
   - Green (#6CC24A) for business value
   - Dark gray (#4D4D4D) for external data sources
   - Mid gray (#999999) for customer configuration
3. **Container Strategy**: Single "Inputs" container groups all data sources
4. **Typography**: Bold cyan title for brand presence

## C4 System Context Diagram

### Source: `src/newcastle-c4-context-final.puml`
### Output: `output/newcastle-context-final.png` and `.svg`

### Iteration Summary

| Version | Key Changes | Consensus |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| v3 (baseline) | Clean L-R flow, unlabeled relationships | ✅ Approved with notes |
| v4 (final) | Added relationship labels, cyan title | ✅ Full approval |

### Key Feedback Themes

**v3 Feedback:**
- Good C4 notation and abstraction level
- Relationship labels were blank - could add clarity
- Minor: Industry Intel at bottom looked less important

**v4 Improvements:**
- Added clear relationship labels: "Feeds rules", "Provides codes", "Supplies intel"
- Cyan "Newcastle" in title for brand consistency

### Final Design Decisions

1. **Layout**: Standard C4 left-to-right flow
2. **Relationship Labels**: Descriptive verbs showing data purpose
3. **System Description**: Emphasizes "AI-powered change detection and impact scoring"
4. **User Personas**: Clear separation of RCM Staff (consumers) and Provider Admin (configurators)

## 5-Second Test Results

Both diagrams pass the 5-second test:

**Markitecture**: "Multiple data sources feed into Newcastle, which delivers intelligence through various channels, resulting in business value like more revenue and fewer denials."

**C4 Context**: "Newcastle takes payer rules, reference standards, and industry intel, then delivers to RCM staff and admins through portal, widget, AI chat, and alerts."
